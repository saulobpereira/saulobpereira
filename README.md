###About

As a software developer with over 16 years of experience in Java and related technologies, I've developed a passion for remote work and leadership. 

I've been fortunate enough to lead remote teams for the past 4 years, where I've developed a management style that emphasizes trust, communication, and collaboration. 

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family and playing music. 

If you're looking for a dedicated and experienced software developer with a passion for remote work and leadership, I'd love to connect with you.
